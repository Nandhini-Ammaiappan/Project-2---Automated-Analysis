# Autolysis: Project 2 of IITM BS Data Science (Diploma)

## _Overview_
This project is to intended for students to learn and explore on the building of application which can use LLMs' for their needs. 

## _Case study_
Any csv file which is provided as input should be analyzed and provide a brief description of it content. Also should produce more advanced statistical information with visual aids like plots. 

## _Key Features_
1. Data loading and validation
2. Data analysis using multiple features of python and LLM
3. Creating plots using analysed data
4. Creating work flow using function calling of LLM
5. Creating summary of the analsyis and storing it in README

## _Technical Requirements_
1. UV - Python Package Manager
2. OpenAI - For interacting with LLM
3. Pandas - For dataframe and handling data received from input csv files
4. Seaborn & Matplotlib - For ploting charts
   
## _Execution_
uv run autolysis.py <input.csv>

## _Output_
* Narratives - _/<input>/README.md_
* Plots - _/<input>/*.png_
